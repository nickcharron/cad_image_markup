DEFINE PERTURBATION LEVELS 

Translation: 
    1: +/- 20 cm 
    2: +/- 50 cm
    3: +/- 1 m 
    4: +/- 2 m 

Rotation: 
    1: +/- 5 degrees 
    2: +/- 10 degrees 
    3: +/- 15 degrees
    4: +/- 20 degrees

Combined: 
    1: 1,1
    2: 2,2
    3: 3,3
    4: 4,4

RESULTS 

-> 20 trials for each view, with each perturbation level for manual labelling (use combined for trials)
-> 20 trials for each view, with each perturbation level for auto labelling (use combined for trials)
-> average all views for each perturbation level for final results
